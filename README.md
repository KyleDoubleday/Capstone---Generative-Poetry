# Capstone---Generative-Poetry
This is my Capstone project for HDCC 209, which generates poems out of found text. The goal is to use a Python script to retrieve and process digital text and compose poems out of it as a way of sampling that text. 

Currently I am using Pronouncing to determine syllabic structures and rhyme, and using beautifulsoup4 and get.requests to sample the main content from HTML documents at a given URL.
